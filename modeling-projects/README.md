# Predictive Modeling Projects 🤖📈

This folder contains a collection of machine learning and statistical modeling projects completed as part of academic and personal development work. Each project explores real-world datasets using regression, classification, and model evaluation techniques.

## 🧠 Projects Included

- **Logistic Regression (Wheat Data)**  
  Classification of wheat varieties (Kama, Rosa, Canadian) using SMOTE, ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and hyperparameter tuning.

- **Linear Regression (Swiss Dataset / Healthcare)**  
  Examined how variables like education or BMI impact outcomes like infant mortality and medical expenses. Model diagnostics included residual analysis, QQ plots, and R² comparisons.

- **Discriminant Analysis (LDA vs QDA)**  
  Compared the performance of linear and quadratic discriminant analysis using structured preprocessing, profiling, and accuracy/F1 evaluations.

- **Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net Models**  
  Applied regularization techniques to improve generalization on small structured datasets with multicollinearity.

## 🧰 Tools & Tech

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- R (caret, tidyverse, ggplot2)
- Jupyter Notebook / R Markdown
- SMOTE, GridSearchCV, model diagnostics

## 📌 Highlights

- Emphasis on interpretability, reproducibility, and model evaluation
- Focused on small-to-medium datasets suitable for educational storytelling
- Explored performance tradeoffs between simplicity and complexity
