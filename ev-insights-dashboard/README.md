# EV Insights Dashboard 🚗🔋

A Tableau-powered data storytelling project exploring performance metrics of electric vehicles (EVs). The dashboard highlights relationships between speed, range, efficiency, acceleration, and segment type to support consumer and market insights.

## 🔍 Visualizations

- **Top 10 Fastest EVs** – Horizontal bar chart of top speeds
- **Range vs. Efficiency** – Scatter plot comparing km range with Wh/km usage
- **Average Range by Segment** – Vertical bar chart
- **Acceleration by Powertrain** – Box plot showing 0–100 km/h times
- **Efficiency Heatmap** – Cross-analysis of vehicle segment and powertrain type

## 📊 Tools & Tech

- Tableau (primary visualization)
- Dataset cleaning and prep in Excel / Python
- Source data: EV specifications (brand, range, top speed, efficiency, etc.)

## 🎯 Key Insights

- High-performance EVs tend to trade efficiency for speed
- Compact and crossover segments offer the most balanced performance
- Powertrain type impacts acceleration more than segment

## 📁 Status

✔️ Complete — Visualization project ready for portfolio  
🗂️ Will upload dashboard screenshots or workbook if allowed
